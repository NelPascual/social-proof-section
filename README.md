## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Among the things I was able to learn and practice in this project are:

- I continue to learn about positioning elements, in the case of this challenge, it took me a long time to position the boxes and achieve multiple alignment of them.

### Continued development

I'm still practicing CSS, this is my ninth challenge completed, and as I mentioned before, I had a hard time positioning the different boxes to get to the proposed design.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
